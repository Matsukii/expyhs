# expyhs
hello there, this is my first project here so any help is welcome!

# initial idea

Expyhs is a project with the objective to let you have weather info in realtime from anywhere, based on ESP8266 board to take data to database accesible from mobile app.
Also, it creates the possbilitie for very small, portable and cheap 'wheather station'.

At the moment i working on mobile app(as my college project for one subject) and the acces to database rest service isn't avaliable, all files for use in localhost will be avaliable soon (this includes: REST api, android app, arduino code for esp8266, database and sensor connection scheme).


# TODO:
Now is only possible to send and get temperature values, the idea is to have as many as possible sensors

- upload arduino code, rest, sql, app (soon -> 15/10)
- unify board data to database queryes in rest
- add easier connection with wireless network (captive portal)
- offline mode (connect and save data directly on app or localhost)
- digital temperature sensor, bmp180/280 and dht22 support
- hall/ir support to use as interruptor for 'anemometer'

# Disclaimer
All the project is in mid phase, it works well on local at the time, so it can be cut any time without notice.
this is my first repository, sorry if i misspelling something
Some things is in portuguese* 

if you read up to now and was interest, please consider give me a feedback!
